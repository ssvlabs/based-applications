## :book: _Description_

This repository contains the SSV Based Applications Platform Contracts.

The contracts are organized under the `src/` directory into two main folders:

- **`core/`**: contains the main platform contract: `SSVBasedApps.sol`;
  
- **`middleware/`** contains the module contracts to build a based application. 

### **The Core Platform**

The core contract is build in a diamond-like pattern: 

- **`SSVBasedApps.sol`** ‚Äì Core contract where all the functions are declared and via an internal proxy it redirects to the right implementation. 

The functions are implemented in 3 different modules:
  
- **`StrategyManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions related to strategies, validator balance delegation, opting-in to bApp, and slashing;
  
- **`BasedAppsManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions related to bApps like the registration and update the metadata;
  
- **`PlatformManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions for updating the global variables like timelocks length, max number of shares, etc. The variable update process will be handled by the SSV DAO.
  
### **The Middleware**

This `middleware` folder contains the modules for building a bapp: 

- **`modules/core`**: the base layer for a bApp to be compliant and be recognized by the system;

- **`examples`**: contains example of working compliant bApps.

## üî® _Slashing Mechanism_

The `slash` function allows for the reduction of a strategy‚Äôs token balance under specific conditions, either as a penalty or to enforce protocol-defined behavior. Slashing can happen in two distinct modes, depending on whether:

**1)** The bApp is a compliant smart contract;

**2)** The bApp is a non-compliant smart contract or an EOA.

### üß† Compliant BApp

If the bApp is a compliant contract implementing the required interface `IBasedApp`,

The slash function of the bApp is called: `(success, receiver, exit) = IBasedApp(bApp).slash(...)`

*	`data` parameter is forwarded and may act as a proof or auxiliary input.

*	The bApp decides:

    *	Who receives the slashed funds by setting the `receiver` fund, it can burn by setting the receiver as `address(0)`;

    *	Whether to exit the strategy or adjust obligations;

    *	If `exit == true`, the strategy is exited and the obligation value is set to 0;

    *	Otherwise, obligations are adjusted proportionally based on remaining balances, the new obligated amount is set to the previous one less the slashed amount;

    *	Funds are credited to the receiver in the slashing fund.

### üîê Non-compliant bApp (EOA or Non-compliant Contract)

If the bApp is an EOA or does not comply with the required interface:

*	Only the bApp itself can invoke slashing;

*	The receiver of slashed funds is forcibly set to the bApp itself;

*	The strategy is always exited (no obligation adjustment);

*	Funds are added to the bApp‚Äôs slashing fund.

### ‚è≥ Post Slashing

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: After an obligation has been exited, it can be updated again to a value greater than 0, but only after a 14-day obligation timelock.

This acts as a safeguard to prevent immediate re-entry and encourages more deliberate strategy participation.

### üí∏ Slashing Fund

Slashed tokens are not immediately transferred. They are deposited into an internal slashing fund.

The `receiver` (set during slashing) can later withdraw them using:

```
function withdrawSlashingFund(address token, uint256 amount) external
function withdrawETHSlashingFund(uint256 amount) external
```

These functions verify balances and authorize the caller to retrieve their accumulated slashed tokens.

## :rocket: _Deployments_

### How to Deploy

**1)** Run the deployment script defined in `scripts/`:

__`‚ùç npm run deploy:holesky`__: verification is done automatically.

__`‚ùç npm run deploy:hoodi`__: verification needs to be done manually for now.
