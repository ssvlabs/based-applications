## :book: _Description_

This repository contains the SSV Based Applications Platform Contracts.

The contracts are organized under the `src/` directory into two main folders:

- **`core/`**: contains the main platform contract: `SSVBasedApps.sol`;
  
- **`middleware/`** contains the module contracts to build a based application. 

### **The Core Platform**

The core contract is build in a diamond-like pattern: 

- **`SSVBasedApps.sol`** ‚Äì Core contract where all the functions are declared and via an internal proxy it redirects to the right implementation. 

The functions are implemented in 3 different modules:
  
- **`StrategyManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions related to strategies, validator balance delegation, opting-in to bApp, and slashing;
  
- **`BasedAppsManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions related to bApps like the registration and update the metadata;
  
- **`PlatformManager.sol`** ‚Äì Implements functions for updating the global variables like timelocks length, max number of shares, etc. The variable update process will be handled by the SSV DAO.
  
### **The Middleware**

This `middleware` folder contains the modules for building a bapp: 

- **`modules/core`**: the base layer for a bApp to be compliant and be recognized by the system;

- **`examples`**: contains example of working compliant bApps.

## :rocket: _Deployments_

### How to Deploy

**2)** Set the environment variables in the `.env` file.

**1)** Run the deployment script `DeployAllHoodi.s.sol` defined in `script/`:

__`‚ùç npm run deploy:hoodi-stage`__: verification is done automatically.

### How to Update Module Contracts

It is possible to update each one of the three modules: `StrategyManager`, `BasedAppsManager` and `ProtocolManager`.

It is possible to update multiple modules at the same time. 

**1)** Go on the Proxy Contract on Etherscan, under "Write as Proxy" call the function:

__`‚ùç updateModules`__: specifying the correct module id and the new module address.

### How to Upgrade the Implementation Contract 

**1)** Go on the Proxy Contract on Etherscan, under "Write as Proxy" call the function:

__`‚ùç upgradeToAndCall`__: specifying the new implementation address. The data field can be left empty in this case.
